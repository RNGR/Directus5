Demo Plugin
Version 1.0
Created by Ben Haynes - 2012

This is a demonstration plugin. It doesn't actually have any cool features, but you can find and add more useful plugins <a href="http://getdirectus.com/support/#plugins">here</a> or make your own, it's easy! Plugins can be anything you need them to be, they are in essence just PHP pages that fit within the Directus framework.

You could find or make a plugin for custom data-entry, special chart views, project managementâ€¦ really anything that you want or need that Directus-Core doesn't offer.
